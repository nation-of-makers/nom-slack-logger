## nom-slack-logger

Hello @everyone, I'd like to formally introduce you to @nombot. He's a script running in Digital Ocean on behalf of NoM. All he does today is record the chatroom activity for the rooms he's in. If you'd like to have his record a transcript of your chatroom, you may simply `/invite @nombot` and he'll record everything going forward. 

### A few caveats about @nombot: 
- He will join but does not work in direct message chatrooms.
- He does not record edits.
- He cannot see into the past. If he wasn't in the room to witness the chatter, he won't record it.
